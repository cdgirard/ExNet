Main Area

1. Exchange Rule - This is set depending on what sort of structural exchange conditions you want to run the network.  Once you have created a BE Network Action with a specific structural exchange condition, the structural exchange condition cannot be changed.
    *Basic - Each node can be set to have a minimum (1 to max) to a maximum (min to number of edges a node has) number of exchanges possible.  Failure of a node to make the minimum number of exchanges results in no points being earned.
    *Subnetworks - As with basic, but now number of exchanges can be assigned across groups of nodes as well as individual nodes.
    *Ordered Subnetworks - As with Subnetworks, but now an ordering of who a node has to trade with can be added.

2. Network Field - Shows the name of the network you have choosen to attach to this BE Network Action.

3. Access Group Field - Shows the access group associated with the choosen network.
