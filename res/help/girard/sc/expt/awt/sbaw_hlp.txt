             Save Base Action Window

Used to save Action objects you have created. To save an object to a file, type the file name you wish to refer to the object as in the available space, select which access group it is related to, and then click "OK".

Main Area
---------
1. Saved Files List - List of files under the selected access group that are already saved.  Only lists Action objects of the same type as the one you are saving.

2. Access Group List - Lists all the access groups that you are either the controller of or a member of within the Web-Lab.  These groups are termed Software Applications within the Web-Lab, a sub-group of the Application access system. By selecting a specific access group, a list of Actions of a specific type saved under that group will be displayed in the Saved Files List.  The "<NONE>" group refers to files that only you can access.

3. The Descriptions - The Description under the Saved File List gives a description of the selected saved file.  The Description under the Access Group List gives a description of the selected Access Group.
*Note: The "<NONE>" access group does not have a description, other Access Groups may not as well.

4. Filename Field - Where you type in the name you want to refer to the Action object as.  If it matches a name in the Saved Files List you will be prompted to make sure that you want to overwrite the older file. 

5. Group Access Field - Shows the selected Access Group that this file will be assigned to when it is saved.  If you assign the file to the "<NONE>" group then only you will be able to access it.
