              Edit CC Period Window

A CCNetworkAction  consists of only one period.  However, the experimenter can alter the number of rounds assigned to it as well as how long each round is allowed to run.  In addition, a user's position within the network can be changed.

Time - The number of ticks each round will take can be set here.  Depending on the speed of your computer network a tick can take as little as a second to multiple seconds in actual time.

Rounds - Allows you to set how many rounds there will be in period you are editing.
